## Selenium POM
This project involves creating automated UI tests using the Selenium WebDriver and implementing the Page Object Model (POM) pattern. The POM design pattern helps in making tests more maintainable and reusable by separating the web elements and their actions into specific page classes. This project includes:
- Setting up Selenium WebDriver for Chrome.
- Writing automated tests using NUnit for testing various functionalities of the Progress Contact Form.
- Implementing POM to manage web elements and interactions on different pages.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites:
- **C#** and **.NET Core** installed on your local machine.
- **NUnit** test framework and **ChromeDriver** for browser testing.


## Contact
For any questions or suggestions, please open an issue in the repository or contact me.
